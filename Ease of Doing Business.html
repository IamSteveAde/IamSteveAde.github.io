	                        To develop the Ease of doing business in Nigeria, SABER must do the following:<ul>
	                        <li>Electricity: Nigeria has improved in this aspect over the years. However, extra work still needs to be done. Nigeria is yet to attain a 24-hour uninterrupted power supply, which is a significant factor affecting the Ease of business in Nigeria. </li>
	                        <li>Resolving insolvency: SABER has to work on resolving the issue of bankruptcy among businesses in Nigeria to develop the Ease of doing business in Nigeria </li>
	                        <li>Registering Property: Nigeria has enhanced its land administration through a geographic information system. However, the work is far from being completed.</li>
	                        <li>Trading across borders: An electronic payment of fees has been introduced, which has significantly reduced the time for complying with documentary and border regulations in Nigeria to 564 hours in 2020 compared to 662.1 hours in 2019. More work still needs to be done. We are still lagging behind in this field despite our previous improvement.</li></ul>
