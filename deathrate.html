							<h1 class="major">Death rate in Nigeria</h1>
							
							Due to my curious nature, I asked myself these 4 questions:
							<ul>

								<li>What is the death rate of diseases caused per year?</li>
								<li>What is the death rate of illnesses that occurred in each state in Nigeria?</li>
								<li>What illness caused the least and the most deaths in Nigeria?</li>
								<li>How many people died or survived a particular illness?</li>
</p>
						</ul>

						<p>I decided to carry out an analysis to answer these disturbing questions with the objective of creating awareness. The dataset used during the course of this analysis was gotten from kaggle.</p>
						<p>According to the data,  the highest death rate occurred in 2017, which Malaria mainly caused, generating the most increased death. In Nigeria, Kano was the central part of Nigeria that was majorly affected by the malaria illness. The death rate reduced significantly in 2018 from 14,399 deaths to 14,127 deaths.

						<p>The lowest death occurred in 2011, with 14,082 deaths. Rubella Mars was majorly the cause of death during this period. Taraba and Adamawa were the states majorly affected by this illness; N.B: Adamawa and Taraba are relatively located next to each other.</p>

						<p>Bayelsa and Ondo were the most affected states from 2009 to 2018. 3,970 deaths occurred in the two states, which was the highest death that happened in every state. Cross river achieved the lowest death with 3,743 deaths from 2009 to 2018.</p>

						<p>Diarrhea caused the most deaths from 2009 to 2018, with a total of 14,361 deaths, with Ebola causing the least number of death with 14,165 numbers of fatalities compared to other illnesses. However, Ebola was the highest cause of death between 2011 and 2016, with 8,609 numbers of death. Malaria was the lowest cause of death during this period.

						<p>Ebola caused the highest number of death compared to the number of people that survived it. Ebola was the deadliest disease, without a doubt. However, the slightest incurable illness was Malaria. Malaria had the highest survival rate compared to how many people died from it.

						<p>In summary, Malaria still kills, especially in the North. Awareness should be carried out. Do not underestimate malaria, cure it as soon as possible to avoid being a victim of malaria. Diarrhea however is the deadliest illness of all. As soon as your system stops functioning well, visit the clinic, and get tested. Your health is the most important thing. Thanks.</p>
