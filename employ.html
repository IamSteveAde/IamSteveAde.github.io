									<p>Unemployment Rate In Nigeria</p>
									<p>This dashboard sheds light on the rate of employment in Nigeria. It answers Six (6) crucial questions concerning Nigeria's unemployment rate.</p>
										<p>•	Comparison of the female's and the male's monthly income
										•	What is the employment rate from 2013 to 2017 in Nigeria?
										•	Comparison of the female and the male employment rate in Nigeria
										•	Can employers afford to rent a house or buy a car with their salary?
										•	What was your first employment income?
										•	What is your current employment income?</p>
									<p>Comparison of the female's and the male's monthly income</p>
									<p>Based on the data, the male gender earned higher figures than the female gender. 363 females earned under NGN 20,000 monthly, while 274 males earned under NGN 20,000 per month in Nigeria between 2013 and 2017. On the other hand, 31 Females earned NGN 250,000 and above, while 86 Males earned NGN 250,000 and above. This shows that the male gender earns more than the female gender.</p>
									<p>What is the employment rate from 2013 to 2017 in Nigeria?</p>
									<p>In 2013, 471 graduates were employed, which increased significantly between 2014 and 2015 from 631 employed graduates to 933 employed graduates in 2015. However, the numbers reduced substantially between 2015 and 2017 from 933 employed graduates to 636 employed graduates.
									On the other hand, in 2013, 121 graduates had no job, which continued to increase over the years. The unemployment rate grew by 200% between 2013 and 2017, which means that the employment rate deterioted during this period while the unemployment rate continued to increase steadily.</p>
									<p>Can you afford to rent an apartment or buy a car with your current income?</p>
									<p>Sadly, only 5% of the graduates could rent an apartment or purchase a car with their income. The remaining 95% percent were either unemployed or underpaid.</p>
									<p>First Employment Monthly Income</p>
									<p>1,776 graduates of the total 5,186 graduates earned nothing during their first employment. 707 graduates earned between NGN 20,000.00 and NGN 49,000.00 during their first employment. 424 graduates earned between NGN 50,000.00 and NGN 99,000.00 during their first employment. 347 graduates earned below NGN 20,000.00 during their first employment. 92 graduates earned between NGN 100,000.00 and NGN 149,000.00 during their first employment. 44 graduates earned between NGN 150,000.00 and NGN 199,000.00 during their first employment. 19 graduates earned above NGN 250,000.00 during their first employment. 15 graduates earned between NGN 200,000.00 and NGN 249,000.00 during their first employment.</p>
									<p>Summary</p>
									<p>The rate of unemployment keeps increasing in Nigeria. The result of this analysis begs the question: Is education worth it in Nigeria? Would you rather get a skill than spend 4 years in college, which would most likely increase depending on other factors, the most concerning being ASUU strike? </p>
